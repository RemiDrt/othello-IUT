# othello-IUT
reversi or othello game, S1 project
files "partie1", "partie2", "partie3" and "programme" contain the game.
file "essaiaffichage" contains different ways to display the board.
folder "termcolor" and "colorama" are needed to display color on the terminal, I did not implement termcolor and colorama, I downloaded them.
Excecute "programme" with python on the terminal to play.
